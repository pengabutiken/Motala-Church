                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Before the present church was built, there was a smaller church on this site, the walls of which are partly part of the present one. 
                    Judging by the masonry, the old church can be dated to the last half of the 13th century.
                     In the 1670s some changes began. As early as 1674, a new choir was consecrated, called the "choir church".
                      A drawing from the 17th century gives us an interesting picture of the choir building. 
                      The chancel quadrate has been completed and the three-sided end, which forms the Kugelhielm burial chancel, is being built.
                    In the 18th century the church was considered too small. 
                    In 1774 the new church was largely completed, the old altarpiece from 1724 served as the altarpiece until 1856, when an oil painting by J.Z. Blackstadius (1816-1898), depicting the resurrection of Jesus from the grave.
                    During the restoration, led by architect Kurt von Schmalensee, the church was given a new sacristy. 
                    The original ceiling with its beautiful blue colour and light-coloured cornice was restored. 
                    The chancel was given a tighter and more liturgical design by the erection of an archway, which serves the same function as a triumphal arch.
                    Blackstadius' altarpiece was replaced by the painted blue draperies on the back wall, which were produced during several repaintings.

                <h2>Today</h2>
                <p>Motala Church is the main church of the parish, which has an impact on the design of the worship service. High mass is usually celebrated every weekend at 11.00. The Mass usually begins with a procession with cross and gospel candles. The Gospel is read in the middle of the congregation. Choirs, singers or instrumentalists usually take part.
                    As Motala Church has two excellent organs and several choirs, there are opportunities for a rich musical life. We sometimes invite singers and musicians from other places to participate. Singing and music are integrated into the services.
                    Music conveys
                    Through the high level of music life, we have reached more and more people who would not otherwise have visited the church. Music is increasingly being witnessed as a conveyor of the Mystery.
                    Family Mass is celebrated one day a month, with the participation of the children's choir.
                    
                    Motala Church is open for individual worship Monday-Friday 9am-4pm and Saturdays 10am-1pm. More and more people come to the church for private prayer and meditation.
