# Motala Church project

# Purpose and goals of Motala Church website

I want this website to serve as an helping hand to anyone interested in the church. The website can work as both as an encyclopedia for people who might be interested in the history of the church and also for tourists or other potential visitors. Motala is a small Swedish town but because of the towns scenery and it's famous beach it's popular with tourists both international and domestic. With this website I hope to highlight another tourist attraction for people that might not be aware of it when visiting. So one goal is to drive the tourists to Motala Church.

Because I want tourists to visit the location, one thing I wanted to implement was a simple UI for them to get the information they need fast. Users are impatient and if the website is unclear or hard to use they will probably just close it down. I wanted to design the homepage just with that in mind. The user is greeted with a picture of the church and a navigation bar to take them where they want.

This website has some potential monetary benefit in the future, one future goal could be to sell ads on the website for local hotels, restaurants and or other tourist attractions. If the website gets enough traffic I could potentially ask other businesses if they want to promote their businesses on my website because the tourists that visit the Motala Church website might be interested in other Motala businesses on their visit here.

# Sections

## Homepage
The Homepage is what the user first see. Therefore I have a picture of the church so it can serve as visual help for the user to understand what the website is about. There is also a heading in the top left corner with the name of the website so people can connect a name to the picture. The homepage also has an short description of the church to give some quick information to the user about the website. The navigation bar is also visible here so the user can click on what section they want to access fast. 

## About Section
The "About" section is where the user can learn about the church. This section has two segments, the History segment and Today segment. 

History is where you can learn about the history of the church, for example when it was built, when it was reconstructed and who was behind it. The history segment is made for anyone who might need to research the church or just is interested in the history. 

The today segment serve a similar purpose as the history segment. To educate the user about the church but this segment is more focused on the present day, what happens in the church nowadays, when is it popular and what you can do there.

The about section is a block of text essentially. When you have a text based section on your website I think its important for the user to be able to read the actual text. User might have difficulties reading and therefore I want to style it in a way where everything is readable. A future improvement could be to implement pictures to enhance the section so it does not get "dull". Another thing to add in the future is just to add more information and expand on it to give more information to the user.

## Contact Section
This section has three different segments, the visit section, the map, and the question section. These all serve the same purpose of preparing the user for a potential visit of the church. This is where the tourists might flock to since it's information that I can see be important to them.

The visit segment is where the user find out about how to visit the church. Here the website informs the user of what options they have and how to go about with these options. Each option carry a ordered list with a simple to follow tutorial on how to get to the church. I think segments like these are crucial for tourists because I can understand the difficulties of visiting a location in a unfamiliar location.

The map is a embedded Google Maps map where you can see the church's location and address. This map segment goes hand in hand with the previous visit segment where the map can serve as a helping hand for users that try to find the church. The map can be enough information for users to find the church this is why I think the map is a must have on tourist websites like this.

If you have read the previous information in the Contact section and still have unanswered questions this  question segment will be a helping hand. Here the user can by entering a email address ask a question about the church or ask for tips ahead of a visit. The user needs to enter email so the owner of the website can answer the question to the right person. Segments like these are very important for users, many people like to have a option for support to ask anything that the website does not inform you about or you might have a specific question that you feel need to be answered. I have previously in my life talked to support ahead of a trip and therefore I wanted to be extra clear about giving an option of support to the user.

## Gallery Page

The gallery page have 4 different sections, but they serve the same purpose and are styled the same. The gallery contains pictures of the church from different angles, interior in the church, the church organs and the church in session. These pictures will serve as a way to paint a picture for the user about the church. As a researcher of the church you might want to see the church through different lenses and the gallery section does just that. For a tourist of the church this section might make up your mind about visiting the church, in different words the gallery page could lure in tourists with enticing photos. This is why the navigation bar is visible on this page too so if get interested in the pictures you can quickly navigate over to the other sections of the website that prepare you for a visit.

# Styling

## Theme
The Theme I wanted to achieve when designing this website was medieval, I think that a medieval theme is fitting on a website about a old church. To follow this theme I picked fonts and colors that help paint this theme.

## Colors
The Main colors of the website are:
-Beige
-Brown
-Black
-White

![Colors uses](/assets/images/colors.png)

These colors are very basic and fit together well on a color palette. They are also user-friendly and help make text readable. The colors also fit in too the medieval theme where there are no bright or neon colors. Beige, brown, black and white also make a user-friendly design as these colors are not bright and could be calming.

## Fonts
The two fonts used:
- Libre Baskerville
- Source Sans Pro

![Libre Baskerville](/assets/images/font1.png)

![Source Sans Pro](/assets/images/font2.png)

Two fonts are recommended for websites as to not make the layouts confusing, so I picked two and especially these two because they compliment each other and fit the theme. Libre Baskerville is the font I used for headings and Source Sans Pro for various smaller text. Libre Baskerville fits perfectly into the medieval theme as it portraits a older style of letters and because the font style is used on headings it's potentially the text you see first and you get confronted with the medieval theme. Source Sans Pro was picked because it looked good with Libre Baskerville and because it's a simple font for reading purposes so it's perfect for the about section where large amount of text can be found.




# Features



## Existing Features

## Navigation bar
The so called navbar is there to help the user find what they want on the website. There are four multiple clickable options for the user to find what they need as quick as possible. The navbar contains the Home button by clicking the "Motala Church" button, About, Contact and Gallery. By pressing these buttons you will be sent to your desired location. The navigation bar is very important to build an accessible UI for users.

## Question section
I wanted to make sure that potential tourist that want to visit the location don't have any unanswered questions ahead of their visit. The user only has to enter their email and the question they want answered. I have used a fieldset tag to contain the form tag. Inside the form tag there is a input with the type of email and a textarea tag to insert your question. The two text inputs are required which means that you have to fill in a email and write something in the textarea before clicking the submit button under.

## Visit boxes
If the user wants to visit the church but don't really know how to yet, this section will try to make up your mind by giving options and explaining the options. This section will serve as a helping hand to potential visitors.

# Features Left to Implement
- Expansion of the gallery page and about section
- Add more boxes to the visit boxes
- Feature to sell ads on website to try to have a monetary gain for the website
- A button to click to translate the full website to different languages to help tourists consume the information

# Testing 
I have sent the link of my website to two of my mates to act as "playtester" for the website, and they found no bugs on the website after trying it for about 10 minutes. They tried the features and tried on various browsers and on both PC and Iphone 12. This is understandable since the website is quite basic its just HTML code with some basic CSS. I'm sure the website would be riddled with bugs if the website had more features and had more coding languages incorporated.
## Bugs

### 1. Mobile responsiveness not working/ Media Query not working properly
When trying the mobile responsiveness on the website the media query tags were forgotten by the website when trying it. Developer tools also didn't see the media query tags that I've made for that particular max-width. I, of course was very frustrated because of this since I'm not that experienced  with media queries in CSS, so I thought it was my fault and started researching Media Queries in CSS. I tried a lot of different max-widths and none worked for anything below 700px, so I continued my research on why Media Queries dont apply to my website.
Solution:
The solution I found was on a post on stackoverflow.com where a user said that if changes in CSS don't show try to update cache. And the solution was that easy. I often update cache but this time I didn't think about it. So I tried the CTRL+SHIFT+R command and everything work as it normally should.

## Validators

- W3C Validator showed no errors : https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpengabutiken.github.io%2FMotala-Church%2F
- Jigsaw Validator showed no errors : http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=sv&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpengabutiken.github.io%2FMotala-Church%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1

## Lighthouse 
Lighthouse results:

![Lighthouse results2](/assets/images/lighthouse2.png)

Where the website is lacking is the performance aspect and as the pictures shows it's because of images. To prevent this in the future I could use a website like (https://tinypng.com/) to minimize the size of image files. I can even use smaller images if I want to have a gallery feature on my website to not make the performance even worse.

# Deployment
I used  GitHub which is a free developer website where you can host projects to deploy my website. GitHub have a feature called GitHub Pages where you can launch your repository to a live website. 
## How To Deploy
On your chosen repository page to the Settings tab in the GitHub repository, then click "Pages". Choose the "main" Branch from the drop-down menu for the source section. The page will automatically update and if everything is working accordingly there will be a link to your website. This link is shareable and can be used on all devices and browsers.
