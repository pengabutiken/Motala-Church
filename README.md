# Features

## Existing Features

## Navigation bar
The so called navbar is there to help the user find what they want on the website. There are four multiple clickable options for the user to find what they need as quick as possible. The navbar contains the Home button by clicking the "Motala Church" button, About, Contact and Gallery. By pressing these buttons you will be sent to your desired location.

## Question section
I wanted to make sure that potential tourist that want to visit the location don't have any unanswered questios ahead of their visit. The user only has to enter their email and the question they want answered. I have used a fieldset tag to contain the form tag.

## Visit boxes
If the user wants to visit but don't really know how to yet, this section will try to make up your mind by giving options and explaining the options. This section will be a huge help to potential visitors.
